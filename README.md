# Odds Portal scraping

This repository contains multiple scraping projects for Odds Portal.

Each one has its own `README.md` so just look in the directories, as detailed below.

Mainly `full_scraper/` is the most comprehensive and will cover most use cases.

**Note that all projects here were developed with Python 3.x and you should run/develop them with at least that**
